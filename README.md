## Carbon assessment with machine learning
This code repository presents a machine learning based method for selection of an Environmental Impact Factor (EIF) for a given product, material, or activity, which is a fundamental step of carbon footprinting. The code documents the methods in the following research papers.

## Installation
Required packages are given in `requirements.txt`
Run the following commands to install the package:
```
git clone https://github.com/amazon-science/carbon-assessment-with-ml.git
cd carbon-assessment-with-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started
For EIO-LCA use: `caml/demo.ipynb`\
for process LCA use: `flamingo/process/generate_ranked_preds.ipynb` 

## Parakeet 
Create+activate conda environment with Python 3.11.7.
```
conda create --name parakeetenv python=3.11.7
conda activate parakeetenv
```
Install the packages
```
pip install -r parakeet/requirements.txt
```
For running the code, you must have an AWS account to call bedrock. 

Create a `User` in your AWS account with your own key `id` and `key` following these steps
```
AWS Console -> IAM -> Users -> Create user -> provide user name -> attach policies directly -> 
    AmazonSageMakerFullAccess
    AmazonS3FullAccess
    AmazonBedrockFullAccess
    -> Create user
AWS Console -> IAM -> Users -> [username] -> Access key 1/create access key -> Local code -> Set description (parakeet) -> copy the "Access Key" and "Secret Access Key"
```

Add these entries in `~/.aws/credentials` file.

```
[AWS_Account_Name]
aws_access_key_id=XXX
aws_secret_access_key=YYY

```
Demo scripts are in the `scripts` folder. Be sure to modify the `OUTPUT_FILE` variable in order to avoid overwritting your results.
```
cd parakeet/scripts
./generate_ranked_preds_eio.sh # for EEIO
./generate_ranked_preds_pLCA.sh # for pLCA
```

## Dataset
The dataset is for research purposes only, and is not indicative of Amazonâ€™s business use for carbon footprinting.

The dataset consists of retail products mapped to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The mapping was done with Amazon Mechanical Turk, aggregating ground truth from 5 annotations per product. The dataset is the basis of estimating the carbon emissions of a product using Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA). Dataset is stored as a Pandas dataframe.
